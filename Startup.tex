\section{Infomation}

Apvlv is an open source software, and was created by Alf. Now, it is still growing.

According to it's name, Apvlv makes people reading their PDF files just like using Vim.

So, Apvlv bindings lots of Vim command and it's behaviour is like Vim. For example, $<$Ctrl-f$>$ to forward page, $<$Ctrl-b$>$ to previous page, 'k','j','h','l' to scroll page up, down, left or right, and so on. 

And, Apvlv can understand how many times you want to run the command.

The only thing you need to do is typing the number before the command. For example, typing '50' and $<$Ctrl-f$>$ will go 50 pages forward, typing '30' and $<$Ctrl-b$>$ will go 30 pages back.

What's more important is that apvlv supports view of a directory as content of pdf document. Pressing 'k' or 'j' to move selected up or down, 'h' or 'l' to collapse or expand a dir, and press 't' will open the selected document in a new tab.

Do you like it? If yes, continue read the help document.

\section{How to start}

\subsection{How to install}

Apvlv uses GNU Autotools as it's build system, you just need to type
\begin{verbatim}
# ./configure
# make
# make install
\end{verbatim}
in terminal to install it to /usr/local.

If you got error message like 'No package 'poppler-glib' found', may be there is no poppler in your system. You need to install it by yourself.

If you want to install apvlv in a custom path, use './configure --prefix=YOUR CUSTOM PATH' instead of './configure'.

\subsection{How to start the binary program}

You can start apvlv by typing 'apvlv' in any terminal which is running under X.

If you got message like 'command not found', make sure the path which apvlv's binary in is in your "PATH" evorment. 

If not, run 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:\$PATH"' to append the path.
